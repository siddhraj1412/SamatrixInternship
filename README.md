# Samatrix Internship Projects 

This repository contains all the work I completed during my **internship at Samatrix**, where I worked on a range of real-world data analysis and machine learning projects.

Samatrix is a data-driven technology company focused on AI, machine learning, and analytics solutions across domains like manufacturing, operations optimization, and sports insights. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

The projects here reflect practical experience gained in statistical modeling, data processing, visualization, and problem-solving using Python and analytical tools.
